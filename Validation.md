# Static Semantics Reference

* [ ] `#use` directives must precede all other declarations.
* [X] `TypeChecker`: All operators and functions are used with the correct number of arguments of the correct type, as explained in the sections on the various language constructs.
* [X] `TypeChecker`: Operators `<`, `<=`, `>=`, and `>` are overloaded in that they apply to type `int` and `char`. Both sides must have the same type.
* [X] `TypeChecker`: Operators `==` and `!=` are overloaded in that they apply to types `int`, `bool`, `char`, `t []`, and `t *`. They do not apply to arguments of type `string` and `struct s`. Both sides must have the same type.
* [X] `TypeChecker`: Structs cannot be passed to or from functions or assigned to variables.
* [X] `ReturnValidator`: All control-flow paths in the body of each function end with a `return` statement of the correct type, unless the function has result type `void`.
* [X] `Resolver`: Every variable must be declared with its type.
* [X] `AssignmentValidator`: Along each control-flow path in the body of each block in each function, each locally declared variable is initialized before its use.
* [X] `Resolver`: Function parameters and locally declared variables with overlapping scopes may not have the same name.
* [X] `Resolver`: Names of functions or variables may not collide with the names of defined types.
* [X] `TypeChecker`: Functions may be declared multiple times with consistent types.
* [ ] Functions that are referenced (and not library functions) must be defined exactly once.
* [X] `Resolver`: Structs may be declared multiple times, but may be defined at most once. Structs declared in libraries cannot be defined.
* [X] `Resolver`: Type names may be defined only once (they cannot be declared).
* [ ] A function `int main();` is implicitly declared and also implicitly referenced, because this is the function called when an executable resulting from compilation is invoked. Therefore, when a collection of sources is compiled, at least one of them must define main to match the above prototype.
* [X] `Resolver`: Field names within each struct must be pairwise distinct.
* [X] `TypeChecker`: Expressions `*NULL` are disallowed.
* [X] `TypeChecker`: Type `void` is used only as the return type of functions.
* [X] `TypeChecker`: Expressions, used as statements, must have a small type or `void`.
* [X] `Resolver`: Undefined structs cannot be allocated.
* [X] (Only used in C1) `continue` and `break` statements can only be used inside loops.
* [X] `Resolver`: The step statement in a for loop may not be a declaration.
* [ ] Integer constants are in the range from 0 to 2^31.
* [X] `Resolver`: `* <lv> ++` and `* <lv> --` must be be explicitly parenthesized to override the right-to-left associative interpretation of `++` and `--`.
* [X] `Resolver`: `\result` is only legal in `@ensures` clauses.
* [X] `Resolver`: `@requires` and `@ensures` can only annotate functions.
* [X] `Resolver`: `@loop_invariant` can only precede loop bodies.
* [X] `Resolver`: `@assert` can not annotate functions
* [X] `Resolver`: Expressions occurring in function annotations can only refer to the functions parameters. Expressions in loop invariants and assertions can also use other local variables in whose scope they occur.
* [X] `AssignmentValidator`: Variables in `@ensures` clauses cannot be assigned to in the body of the function they annotate.
